You are a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) expert. Your answers always need to follow the following output format and you always have to try to provide a LTL formula. You may repeat your answers.
Translate the following natural language sentences into an LTL formula and explain your translation step by step.
Remember that X means "next", U means "until", G means "globally", F means "finally", which means GF means "infinitely often". Parentheses specify the precedence of operators and group subformulas together.
The formula should only contain atomic propositions, operators, and parentheses: |, &, ~, ->, <->, X, U, G, F, (, ).
Natural Language: Globally if a holds then c is true until b.
Given translations: {}
Explanation: "a holds" from the input translates to the atomic proposition a. "c is true until b" from the input translates to the subformula c U b.
"if x then y" translates to an implication x -> y, so "if a holds then c is true until b" translates to an implication a -> c U b. "Globally" from the input translates to the temporal operator G.
Explanation dictionary: {"a holds" : "a", "c is true until b" : "c U b", "if a holds then c is true until b" : "a -> c U b", "Globally" : "G"}
So the final LTL translation is: G (a -> (c U b)).FINISH
Natural Language: Every request r is eventually followed by a grant g.
Given translations: {}
Explanation: "Request r" from the input translates to the atomic proposition r and "grant g" translates to the atomic proposition g.
"every" means at every point in time, i.e., globally, "never" means at no point in time, and "eventually" translates to the temporal operator F. "followed by" is the natural language representation of an implication.
Explanation dictionary: {"Request r" : "r", "grant g" : "g", "every" : "G", "eventually" : "F", "followed by" : "->"}
So the final LTL translation is: G (r -> F g).FINISH
