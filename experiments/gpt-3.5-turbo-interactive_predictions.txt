Whenever the inputs a and b are the same, the outputs c and d are the same.;G ((a <-> b) -> (c <-> d));G(((a <-> b) -> (c <-> d)));{}

Whenever a holds and b holds in the next step, then c holds one step after b.;G (a && X b -> X X c);G(((a & X(b)) -> (X(b) -> X(c))));{}

a holds in every fifth step.;a && G (a -> X ! a && X X ! a && X X X ! a && X X X X ! a && X X X X X a);G (a holds at time t if t % 5 = 0). Note that this formula contains a non-atomic proposition, but it can be rewritten as a conjunction of atomic propositions using the distributive property of the modulo operator. For example, if the time steps are numbered from 0 to infinity, the formula can be rewritten as G ((a holds at time 0) & ~(a holds at time 1) & ~(a holds at time 2) & ~(a holds at time 3) & ~(a holds at time 4) & (a holds at time 5) & ...);{}

a must always hold, but if is execeeds, it allow two timestamps to recover.;! G (! (a && X a));G a -> (F (not a) -> (X(Xa)) U a);{}

It is always the case that a is the same as b in the next step.;G (a <-> X b);G((a <-> X(b)));{}
